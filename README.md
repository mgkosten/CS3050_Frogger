In order to run the file one must install arcade. (pip install arcade)

To run the game, rune game_view.py. This will create the game.

- Move the frog using the arrow keys or a,s,d, and w. Try and move the frog across the screen and make it into one of the homes. Try and get all 5 frogs in all the homes.
- There are 3 lives. Once all 3 are used the game is over. For each frog you have to make it across within the timer time limit otherwise it is counted as a death
