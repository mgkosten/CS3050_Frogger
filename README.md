# CS3050_Frogger
In order to run the file one must install arcade. (pip install arcade)
If using and IDE to run the file, make sure that firebase-admin is installed in the python interpreter it is using. 
For example, if using pycharm, do file>>settings>>project Name>>Python interpreter, click the + button in the left corner, search for firebase-admin and install if it needed. 

To run the game, rune game_view.py. This will create the game.

## Instructions To Play
- Move the frog using the arrow keys or a,s,d, and w. Try and move the frog across the screen and make it into one of the homes. Try and get all 5 frogs in all the homes.
- There are 3 lives. Once all 3 are used the game is over. For each frog you have to make it across within the timer time limit otherwise it is counted as a death
- Avoid the cars (if hit you will die)
- Ride the logs and turtles to cross the river, falling in will result in death

## Old Files
- frogger.py is included in the repo as reference from Sprint One, no longer needs to run or worry about pylint because of class restructuring
